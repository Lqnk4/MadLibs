It was a ADJ november day.
I woke up to the ADJ smell of BIRD roasting in the ROOM downstairs.
I VERB down the stairs to see if I could help VERB the dinner.
My mom said, "See if NAME needs a fresh NOUN."
So I carried a tray of glasses full of NOUN into the VERB room.
When I got there, I couldn't believe my NOUN!
There were NOUN VERB on the NOUN!
